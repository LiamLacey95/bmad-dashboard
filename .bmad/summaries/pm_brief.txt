Project Overview
- Build a unified web dashboard for BMAD development operations so managers can monitor workflow execution, delivery progress, cost, and agent performance in near real time.
- The product solves fragmented visibility across tools/logs by centralizing operational decision-making in one interface.

Key Requirements (PM-Relevant)
- MVP modules must all be available in one dashboard: workflow monitoring, project management, cost tracking, agent analytics, document viewer, and story Kanban.
- Real-time behavior is mandatory: workflow/status/cost/story changes should push via WebSocket (no manual refresh dependency).
- Workflow view must show current state, transitions with timestamps, and blocked/failed items.
- Project views must support status/ownership visibility, progress indicators, and due-date awareness.
- Cost views must support aggregate + per-project perspectives and time-window filtering.
- Agent analytics must support trend comparison and outlier detection.
- Document artifacts must be viewable in-app from project/story context.
- Dark mode is a first-class MVP requirement across major views.
- Responsive web app required; mobile-native app is explicitly out of scope.

Technical Constraints
- Stack is fixed for MVP: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), SQLite (database), WebSocket (real-time channel).
- SQLite is acceptable for initial moderate usage but may limit scale/concurrent writes; architecture should preserve future DB migration path.
- Reliable real-time UX requires reconnect handling, heartbeat/sync logic, and clear stale-state visibility.
- Analytics credibility depends on consistent event logging, timestamp fidelity, and clear metric lineage.

Decisions Already Made
- MVP is single-instance, SQLite-backed, with moderate load assumptions.
- Advanced forecasting/ML, complex permissions/multi-tenant billing, deep external integrations are deferred.
- Core priority is operational monitoring/control first; prevent scope creep into advanced analytics.

Open Questions / Blockers
- Final KPI definition for “agent performance” (speed, quality, rework, acceptance, etc.).
- Final real-time SLA target (suggested candidate: <=3s backend event to UI update).
- MVP auth/RBAC depth (minimal vs required controls).
- Initial document formats for viewer support.
- Kanban interaction scope for MVP (read-only vs editable drag/drop).
- Historical retention windows for cost/performance analytics.
- Max concurrent users/workflows to validate architecture sizing.

PM Priorities for Next Alignment
- Run stakeholder session to lock KPI definitions, real-time SLA, and MVP boundaries (especially access control, Kanban editability, analytics depth).
- Convert these decisions into phase-1 acceptance criteria and success metrics.
